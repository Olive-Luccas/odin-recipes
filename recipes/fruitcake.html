        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Candied and dried fruits:</strong> This Christmas fruitcake calls for candied cherries and citrus peels; dried currants and raisins; and dates.</li>
            <li><strong>Nuts:</strong> Blanched, slivered almonds add nutty flavor and welcome crunch.</li>
            <li><strong>Brandy:</strong> The fruits are soaked in brandy overnight to enhance the festive, boozy flavor of this Christmas cake.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour creates structure and helps hold the batter together.</li>
            <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This Christmas cake is flavored with cloves, allspice, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking soda:</strong> Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cake rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Molasses and apple juice:</strong> A blend of molasses and apple juice lends moisture and adds flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong> A cup of unsalted butter ensures a moist cake and adds richness.</li>
            <li><strong>Brown sugar:</strong> Instead of white sugar, this Christmas cake recipe calls for warm and cozy brown sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Six whole eggs add moisture and help bind the cake batter together.</li>
        </ul>
